# virufy3.github.io

The third version of [Virufy's website](https://virufy.org).

## Getting Started

The website is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).

Please make sure you have the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as well as its package manager `npm` before continuing.

### Install dependencies

It is recommended to install depenencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to take advantage of the `yarn.lock` file, but npm will work as well.

```bash
$ yarn install # or npm install
```

### Build

```bash
$ yarn build # or npm run build
```

### Start the web server

```bash
$ yarn start # or npm start
```

## Develop

### Start the development server

```bash
$ yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

### Formatting and linting

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [eslint](https://eslint.org/) are run automatically before every commit. You can run them across the entire project manually using the following commands:

```bash
$ yarn format # or npm run format
```

Or

```bash
$ yarn lint # or npm run lint
```

        "description": "A crowdsource research done by University of Cambridge that used cough samples and breathing to understand how discernible COVID-19 sounds are from those in asthma or healthy controls. Their results show that even a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify correctly healthy and COVID-19 sounds. Our models achieve an AUC above 70% across all tasks. This work inspires further investigation of how automatically analyzed respiratory patterns could be used as pre-screening signals to aid COVID-19 diagnosis [1].",

The rationale behing the study is that, \"the sound of our voice (regardless of language), and the sounds we make when we breathe or cough change when our respiratory system is affected. The changes range from coarse, clearly audible changes, to minute changes -- what we call \"micro\" signatures, that are not audible to the untrained listener, but are nevertheless present [2].",
